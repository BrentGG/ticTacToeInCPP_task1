# ticTacToeInCPP_task1

This is tictactoe written for my cpp uni course. 

Other contributors did a small bug fix, doing this resulted in extra points for them.

### How to run?

#### Docker

You must run with the -it flag.

For example, docker run -it <image id>

Pull the docker container from the packages tab, currently support it on linux/amd64,linux/arm64 and linux/arm/v7. This should work on almost all machines, but if it doesnt you can make a issue for whatever architecture you need.

#### Windows

For windows you can download the builded artifact, unzip and run the exe. (DLL's **NEED** to be in the same folder as the executable).
