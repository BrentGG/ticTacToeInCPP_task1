# ticTacToeInCPP_task1

This is tictactoe written for my cpp uni course. Other contributors did a small bug fix, doing this resulted in extra points for them.

### How to run?

For windows download the builded artifact.

For anything else, compile from scratch.

### Points

#### Basics
- [X] useful and proper class (explain why)
- [X] useful and correct abstraction (explain why)
- [X] useful and correct encapsulation (explain why)
- [X] useful and correct inheritance (explain why)
- [X] useful and correct polymorphism (explain why)
- [X] useful and correct object composition (explain why)
- [X] useful and correct base class
- [X] useful and correct abstract base class
- [X] useful and correct virtual function
- [X] no error in object-oriented programming

#### Supplementary
**General**
- [X] clean main (i.e. nothing in the main that belongs in a class)
- [X] no globals, but statics if needed
- [X] correct safeguards
- [X] maintainability through clean uniform code style and proper function naming and/or comments everywhere
- [X] separate header files
- [X] one complete project that compiles and does not crash
- [X] fully working project
- [X] sufficient git commits (+/- weekly)
- [X] correct files on git
- [X] working build manual as readme on GitHub (project must be buildable from scratch on a clean PC)

**OOP**
- [X] at least 2 standard constructors
    - Player and PlayGame class.
- [ ] at least 2 parameterized constructors
- [ ] at least 2 copy constructors
- [X] at least 2 destructors
    - Player and PlayGame class.
- [ ] member initialization in constructors (the stuff after a colon)
- [ ] constructor forwarding
- [X] useful proven (dynamic) polymorphism
- [ ] useful use of "this" (if code doesn't work without it)
- [X] useful member function
- [X] default values in function definition
    - setPlayerName
- [X] useful member variable
- [X] useful getters and setters for member variables
- [X] correct use of inline function
- [ ] useful template function or class
- [ ] useful friend function or class

**C++**
- [ ] everything in one or more custom namespaces
- [X] 2 useful unsigned chars or other better use of memory-efficient type
    - PlayGame::makePlayerObjects, player.h
- [ ] at least 4 useful const references for variables
- [ ] at least 4 useful const references for functions
- [ ] at least 4 useful bool
- [X] dynamic memory allocation (new)
- [X] dynamic memory delete (delete)
- [X] 2 useful (modern) call-by-references
- [X] useful string class usage
- [ ] useful container class
- [X] useful use of nullptr
- [X] useful use of (modern) file I/O
- [ ] useful exception handling
- [ ] useful use of lambda function
- [ ] useful use of threads

**Extension**
- [ ] useful Qt class
- [ ] useful use of signals/slots
- [ ] test-driven development (= written test plan or unit tests)
- [X] bug ticket resolution (with pull request or commit message issue link and issue branch)
- [X] reporting a bug ticket on another project
- [ ] use of a GUI
- [ ] use of OpenGL or another 3D engine
- [ ] useful use of an external library (not Qt)
- [ ] project working with hardware
- [X] a nice extra that you think deserves a rating (things you put time into that are not rewarded by an item above)
    - Github Action to compile the program.
